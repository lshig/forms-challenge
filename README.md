# forms-challenge

Check out the [Live Demo](https://lshig.github.io/forms-challenge)!

A way for me to experiment with front-end frameworks and forms.

## Project Timeline
- [x] JavaScript ES5: View Spaghetti
- [x] JavaScript ES5: MVC + Design Patterns
- [ ] JavaScript ES2015+, Webpack, Babel
- [x] JavaScript ES2015+, React, JSX, Webpack, Babel
- [x] JavaScript ES2015+, React, Redux, JSX, Webpack, Babel
- [ ] JavaScript ES2015+, Vue, Webpack, Babel
- [ ] Typescript, Angular

## Methodology
Start with documentation. Build using examples and/or starter pack resources. Build for GitHub Pages. Go from JavaScript DOM basics and add design patterns, then move on to view libraries, and finally to fuller front-end MVVM/MVC frameworks.

## JavaScript Background
- Back in 2013, I started learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL and full stack development by diving head first into a jQuery, Express, Node.js, and MySQL stack.
- Between between 2013 to 2016, my projects involved AngularJS, Express, Node.js, and MySQL, while also experimenting with multiple databases like MongoDB, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle.
- In early 2014, AngularJS announced Angular2.0 + Typescript.
- Between mid-2014 to the beginning of 2015, io.js forked from Node.js and by mid-2015, io.js and Node.js merged.
- Between 2016 to now, I've dabbled with React, JSX, ES2015+, Babel, and Webpack through workshops and side projects.
- As of early 2017, Vue.js, React.js, and Angular seem to be the 3 most popular front-end tools.
- This project exists for fun and with a quote in mind: "Gotta catch'em all."

Thanks for stopping by to see the things I like to experiment on!
